## An Interdisciplinary Blog 
#### on General regularities of CONTROL and DATA processing in animals, machines and society ^[ [D.A. Novikov on Cybernetics](http://www.mtas.ru/biblio/Cyb2.pdf)].

Hi everybody! This blog is about things I'm passionate about. I can hardly imagine myself in a place of narrow specialization and the exploration of connections between fields brings me a lot of joy.^[... but no problem is too small if you can help to solve it (thank you, Mr. Feynman)] I love writing about economics, machine learning, applied mathematics, solving business problems with statistical models and operationalizing them.

### Announcement
In 2017-2018 this blog was mostly about economics, R and data visualization. ^[ My hobby is thinking about how can we improve economic models, and perhaps the answer is to step outside the field, gather new tools and inspiration from Complexity Science. Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis give us very general classes of models which we could use. As Machine Learning is overcoming challenges which seemed impossible before, I hope the [Data Geeks](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-25/data-geeks-are-taking-over-economics) will take over economics as well!] This year (2019) has been the busiest, most productive of my life and the focus shifted to data science topics, machine learning, bayesian statistics and time series. Also, expect to see a mix of Python, R, Google Cloud, Agile and going from exploration to production.

### Fun Facts
  Quiet until you get to know me, former professional chess player, love landscape photography, wide range of music: from Regina Spektor to SOAD.

`Collaborators:` ^[ The list of people who encouraged and contributed to my growth is too large to fit here. It matters a lot to me, so thank you all!] Dr. Ruxanda Gheorghe, Dr. Iulian Cimpean, Jumanazar Gurbanov, colleagues @Adore Me, [Fabrica de studenti simpatici](https://www.facebook.com/Fabrica-de-studenti-simpatici-572176539508310/)
