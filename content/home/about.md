## An Interdisciplinary Blog 
#### on General regularities of CONTROL and DATA processing in animals, machines and society ^[ [D.A. Novikov on Cybernetics](http://www.mtas.ru/biblio/Cyb2.pdf)].

Hi everybody! This blog is about things I'm passionate about. I can hardly imagine myself in a place of narrow specialization and the exploration of connections between fields brings me a lot of joy.^[... but no problem is too small if you can help to solve it (thank you, Mr. Feynman)] I love writing about economics, solving business problems with statistical models and programming in R.

My hobby is thinking about how can we improve economic models, and perhaps the answer is to step outside the field, gather new tools and inspiration from Complexity Science. Machine Learning and Bayesian Analysis give us very general classes of models which we could use. As Machine Learning is overcoming challenges which seemed impossible before, I hope the Data Geeks will take over economics as well! ^[ [Data Geeks are taking over economics](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-08-25/data-geeks-are-taking-over-economics)]
