<h1>Introduction by Example</h1>
<p>In search of a suitable dataset for statistical analysis of social
networks, I stumbled upon many interesting applications, from the
classical Karate Club to Email, Citations of Scientific Articles,
Transportation and Biology. Unfortunately, there is a tradeoff between
how manageable it is to work with the data in terms of volume and how
interesting are the patterns to be discovered. The most promising way
seemed to explore the scientific literature or knowledge graphs like
DBPedia, but it’s quite a difficult and heavy task.</p>
<p>This is why I extracted my own network of Facebook friends, because I
knew there are a few heterogeneous communities and the results could be
interesting. It turned out even more surprising and insightful when
applying the algorithms for the layout and node importance. <strong>The
immediate contribution</strong> is that this anonimized dataset can be used for
teaching and academic purposes, testing of algorithms on graphs.</p>
<p>Moreover, it enables us to validate the results of algorithms with the
actual knowledge of the communities and “important” people in it. First,
I use the default visualization of the crawler and encode the knowledge
I have about the network on the graph in the next page. Then, using
<strong>python</strong> and <strong>networkx</strong> package try to visualize it, but this time
by calculating importance metrics via <strong>PageRank</strong>, <strong>Hits</strong>, the
central and peripheral nodes according to the definition.</p>
<p>The observation is that the overlap between statistical insights and
“ground truth” is quite large. Because the network is real and not
idealized, some “hubs”, i.e. people connecting different clusters aren’t
identified. Instead, it finds important people within the clusters, and
interpretation of this will be discussed later.</p>
<p>The first graph is quite complicated, so let’s review the
<strong>communities</strong> which are clearly seen and shaded for clarity. The top
cluster represents people from my highschool in Chisinau, Moldova. They
are connected by a chess player to the quite large chess community of
which I took part for many years. The chess cluster in turn is connected
to my family, which joined later and are also interested in this game.</p>
<p>Moreover, the network doesn’t have timestamps, but hypothetically, if I
had them, I could tell how the network developed to its final state. It
is by no means an impediment of telling the story. We can move on to the
times I moved to Bucharest for CSIE bachelor, and we see within the
central, big cluster several sub-communities, the first one being the
foreign students, with which other foreign students, of course interact
a lot. The second part, people from university are pretty much the same
during the Bachelor and Masters. The person connecting the highschool,
diaspora and university is my roommate and chess with CSIE a grandmaster
who is also a professor.</p>
<p>Another source of connections are different conferences, summer schools
and workshops, for example in Risk Management, Mathematics and Data
Science. These nodes are not differentiated too well in the network, but
the fact that the algorithm placed them in the same neighborhood is very
insightful. Inside the Cybernetics Masters’, the red point, also
confirmed by PageRank is the most <strong>central</strong> person, the chief of
students’ senate.</p>
<p>Moving next, we see a sparsely connected region of PhD students and
Teaching Assistants. They, and the Cybernetics cluster are connected to
the firm I’m working with by a professor who was a consultant at our
firm. The last community is the Bucharest Machine Learning and Tech
people, who use to be very active in meetups and conferences inside the
capital.</p>

<p>Now we are armed with the knowledge and interpretation of this graph and
can start with a blank slate, using the raw data, which is stored in a
<strong>json</strong> format <code>{âsourceâ: 476, âtargetâ: 87}</code>, later transformed in an
<strong>edge list</strong> and finally a <strong>networkx</strong> <code>Graph()</code> object. Now we can
visualize this object in python, using different layout algorithms,
calculate statistics and starting exploring the dataset as if we knew
nothing about it. The node labels are numbers in order to anonimize the
data, without much loss of insight.</p>
<pre basicstyle="\ttfamily\small" language="python" caption="Loading the data"><code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import json
import networkx as nx
from pprint import pprint
%matplotlib inline

with open(&#39;bizovi.json&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;) as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    
df = pd.DataFrame([(x[&quot;source&quot;], x[&quot;target&quot;]) for x in data[&quot;links&quot;]], 
    columns=[&quot;n1&quot;, &quot;n2&quot;])
df.head()

G = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(df, &#39;n1&#39;, &#39;n2&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Classical measures of centrality like degree, average clustering,
betweenness centrality, despite their simplicity and power they all have
the downside of how complex of patterns can they represent or suggest.
This is where iterative, algorithmic approaches like Scaled PageRank and
HITS come into play. The first one can be interpreted as the probability
of ending up in a node when traversing the graph by a random walk a
<strong>sufficiently long</strong> time. Hits uses another approach with the concepts
of Authority and Hubs. It is important to note that they both were
developed for directed graphs in the context of web pages and hyperlinks
pointing to them and they show their full power there. Nonetheless, they
can still be used for undirected graphs, as I did here.</p>
<pre basicstyle="\ttfamily\small" language="python" caption="Hits and PageRank"><code>_ = plt.hist(nx.pagerank(G).values(), bins=30, color=&#39;.5&#39;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;PageRank&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;Count&quot;)
plt.title(&quot;Distribution of the PageRank Score&quot;)
plt.show()

pagerank = nx.pagerank(G, alpha=0.8)
high_rank = [key for key, val in pagerank.items() if val &gt; 0.0042]

hits = nx.hits(G, max_iter=1000)
_ = plt.hist(hits[0].values(), bins=30, color=&#39;.5&#39;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;Authority Score&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;Count&quot;)
plt.title(&quot;Hits&quot;)
plt.show()

high_hits = [key for key, val in hits[0].items() if val &gt; 0.005]</code></pre>
<p>First, I apply the algorithms and then look at the distribution of node
“importance” in order to identify a good treshold for the visualization.
The important nodes are then stored into <code>high_rank</code> and <code>high_hits</code>
variables. The parameter <strong>alpha</strong> is essential for the PageRank not to
get stuck into loops and distorting the distribution.</p>

<p>As a further warm-up, let’s calculate a few statistics on this graph,
which interpretation we will discuss later. The two statistics which can
vary greatly in conclusions by network type, in this case pretty much
agree: the <strong>average clustering</strong> (0.49) and <strong>transitivity</strong> (0.45).
The central and peripheral nodes will be displayed directly on the
graph. The <strong>diameter</strong> of the network is 8, <strong>radius</strong> is 4 and the
<strong>average shortest path</strong> between any node to other node is 3.26.</p>
<pre basicstyle="\ttfamily\small" language="python" caption="Statistics Calculation"><code>periphery = nx.periphery(G)
center = nx.center(G)
min_node_cut = nx.minimum_node_cut(G)
nx.average_clustering(G), nx.transitivity(G)
print(nx.average_shortest_path_length(G))
print(nx.diameter(G))</code></pre>
<p>Now it is time to visualize the network and add the nodes which were
calculated above according to criteria of importance. It is important to
note that <strong>networkx</strong> is NOT primarily a visualization of network
package: it uses the standard matplotlib, but it is good enough for
small networks such as this one. In just 12 lines of code we get a
publication-ready visualization. For more advanced use-cases
<strong>graphviz</strong> and <strong>Gephi</strong>, <strong>igraph</strong> in R can be more suitable. In the
next part, these repetitive operations will be wrapped up in a generic
function which automates this a little bit painful process.</p>

<p>The network is <strong>reversed</strong>, but even cleaner than the one generated by
lostcircles. We can see on the graph on the next page that the periphery
is not that large as expected. Three, or even four important people who
connect clusters are correctly identified either by <strong>centrality</strong> or
PageRank algorithm. Moreover, it identifies very well connected people
inside the clusters.</p>
<p>For the minimal node cut there are multiple choices, but it seems that
the algorithm “thinks” that the family is the most poorly connected
cluster to the other ones, which, looking at the picture is absolutely
reasonable, as we have to remove only one node to achieve a
disconnection, the green one.</p>
<p>One a side note, good graph datasets for teaching are relatively rare,
and with closure of Facebook API and LinkedIn API, researchers working
with network data may stick with the old datasets. This one seems
interesting enough for tutorials and projects.</p>
<p>A few comments on what the code does: first it sets up the environment,
defining the size of the picture and deleting the axis, then it
calculates the position of each node by the Fruchterman Reigold
Algorithm. The first layer of grey nodes is added, together with all of
the connections. Then the peripheral nodes calculated above are
displayed in beige with the function <code>nx.draw_networkx_nodes</code>, which
also requires the position, the Centrality, Minimum Cut and PageRank are
added in turn. The finishing touch is the legend.</p>

<p>The last two obvious things to try are calculating the Local Clustering
Coefficient and seeing the correlation between Node degree and LCC. We
see that the first follows a pretty symmetric distribution, with
exception of the stack at zero, which is expected in such a network. It
means that there are nodes which are highly clustered and some not at
all, but the majority at around 0.5.</p>
<p>The correlation with the Node Degree shows that as node degree
increases, the expected LCC drops. This relationship is usually
visualized at a log scale, but our network is not enough for this to be
necessary and for the pattern to emerge. There is also an interesting
boundary on the top of the point cloud. Remember how we calculated the
average clustering above (0.49) and it agreed in large with the
alternative method of transitivity, which is based on the concept on
“triangle closure”. It means that networks, in which pairs of 2 out of 3
nodes are connected, tend to “produce” closures within those triplets.</p>

<p>Below is the code which uses list comprehensions and nx functions on the
graphs in order to compute and plot the distributions of the degree and
LCC.</p>

<h1>Exploratory data analysis of classical Network datasets</h1>
<p>There are numerous articles and courses which discuss the theory behind
the measures and algorithms I used in the previous section, so the
reader is encouraged to look them up in the bibliography. In order to
keep the spirit of this project as a tutorial and storytelling, let’s
move on to other applications, mainly from the business and research
fields.</p>
<p>Here we will have the chance to develop in more depth the programming
skills on smaller dataset, which is a better strategy for learning.
However, I wanted to show the “big” example first, for the most exciting
stuff, to see what is possible to do and only then learn the skill.</p>
<div id="bipartite-graphs-and-recommender-systems" class="section level2">
<h2>Bipartite Graphs and Recommender Systems</h2>
<p>There is an important subclass of graphs, called bipartite graphs which
are extremely useful in Recommender Systems. It consists of two sets of
nodes <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{V}=(L, R)\)</span> with no edges between the nodes within each
set, but with <span class="math inline">\(\{ E(u, v) : u \in L , v\in R \}\)</span>. If we view the sets as
users and products/items or fans and teams the edges can represent
preferences or affiliations. From this point the Machine Learning and
Recommender System goes into a direction orthogonal to ours. What we
will do in the following simple example is to find <strong>projections</strong> of
users and items which would indicate us the similarity between them.</p>

<p>The following toy example is given as an exercise to the Coursera course
on Applied Social Network Analysis in Python. <span class="citation">[@coursera_social]</span> It
represents different users and the movies they prefer. For the ones
willing to go through it an important warning is that it was build with
the networkx 1.x API, which is largely incompatible with 2.x (current
version), which means that almost all of the code and serialized data is
broken. I have rewritten everything with respect to the latest version,
which will be the one officially maintained.</p>
<p>Taking the projection of a bipartite graph means having an edge between
“users” or “movies” when the two nodes have the connection with the same
counterpart. The weights on the edges will be given by the number of
overlaps (i.e. common movies both “Lee” and “Joan” liked). I display
below both views, in the user space and item space. As the underlying
file has an unfortunate format for loading, I declare this small network
directly in Python.</p>

<p>We discussed earlier the need to write a function which will automate
the beautiful drawing of small graphs, as the defaults given by networkx
are dreadful. A random seed is also used to ensure reproducibility of
the graph. The last feature is having an option to draw bipartite graphs
automatically, as networkx will choose another layout, not so suitable
for drawing bipartite graphs. The projection is given by a submodule
<strong>networkx.algorithms.bipartite</strong>.</p>

<h1>Graph LASSO: Trust, Branding and E-Commerce</h1>
<p>Two years ago, I stumbled upon an interesting survey done by our
Branding Consultant, which had the goal of identifying what is the
perception and what matters for the users and potential clients of Adore
Me, a lingerie e-commerce in the United States. A part of that was
understanding what factors would drive a repurchase, would motivate
people to recommend the brand to their friends and what factors drive
the satisfaction. The questions were split into several categories and
given to a stratified sample of customers from different segments: Male
and Female, New and Experienced online, by Favorite Brand and Segment
type of our existing customers. I do not specify the original questions,
but the responses were on a scale of 1 to 5 according to the strength of
agreement.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Emotional: <strong><span class="math display">\[Comfort, Offers, Self-Perception, Value,
Expensive\]</span></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Rational: <strong><span class="math display">\[Quality, Variety, Size, Fit, Delivery\]</span></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Presence: <strong><span class="math display">\[Website, Models, Breadth, New, Information\]</span></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Brand: <strong><span class="math display">\[Body, Young, Favorite, Trust, Recommended\]</span></strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing a statistician would do is to run some Factor Analysis
on this cross-sectional data and interpret it, but the problem is that
we really, want to see the influence of the factors on our targets. This
can be done with a logistic regression, but we have 3 targets. We can
apply a multinomial regression, but there is also an alternative
approach.</p>
<p>This is a typical problem where we have some data
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x_i} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_d)^T\)</span> for each customer
<span class="math inline">\(i = 1, ..., N\)</span> and an underlying (unknown) distribution
<span class="math inline">\(p(X_1, ..., X_n)\)</span> associated with it. By making some assumptions, we
want to infer a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> where the nodes are variables and the edges
represent a strength of association or technically, an information flow.</p>
<p>The problem of using the correlation matrix is that it doesn’t represent
what we want, i.e. the conditional independence relationships
<span class="math inline">\((X_i || X_j ) |X_k\)</span>. Fortunately this is exactly what the precision
matrix does, but this approach is prone to noise and “overfitting”. We
want to penalize the edges such that only the most relevant ones remain.
This is where the approach of Graphical LASSO comes to rescue.</p>
<p>After applying the algorithm, we visualize the graph for different
segments, trying to read from the graph what paths lead to our targets
and how different factor are positioned. This approach is similar in
philosophy with factor analysis, but attacking the problem from a
different angle.</p>

</div>
<div id="conclusions" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>As a data scientist/ machine learning researcher it was useful to step
outside the (statistical) approaches on cross-sectional and panel data
with which we usually work and explore applications driven by the
network data.</p>
<p>We looked at a fun and practical example of analysing a network of
friends by applying some classical algorithms on it, managing to
characterize quite a large part of its features and structure. A future
area of improvement and research would be to see how such networks
evolve in time, by enriching the data with timestamps of “friendship
requests acceptance”. In this process, I learned a lot about practical
statistical analysis of graph data and hope to pass this hands-on
experience to the readers.</p>
<p>In the second part we looked at the opposite perspective, of graph
inference, as usually, in business settings we don’t have network data
available or even remotely achievable because of privacy concerns.
Insted we have a lot of data on our users in which we track several
variables. The example at hand was a survey related to branding and the
graph we inferred with the Graphical LASSO, showed interesting pathways
of information flow between variables, with interesting differences
between several segments of customers. Basically, we gained much more
insight into what is important for them and what is likely to drive a
recommendation, repurchase or the customer being satisfied. If we have
done a logistic regression we would not see the whole picture, hence the
power of graphs, again.</p>
