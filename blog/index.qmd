**At my day job,** I'm a generalist -- navigating uncertainty and complexity to improve decision-making at scale.

**As a teacher,** I aspire to contribute to the understanding of AI's complex landscape; how to navigate it, develop valuable skills, and become more effective at problem-solving.

**As a person,** I aspire to a life of wisdom and meaning.
