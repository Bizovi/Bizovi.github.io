In the [homepage](index.qmd), you saw the different roles that are important to me: the craft, teaching, and just being. 

On another note, my interests in AI, art, cognitive science, and philosophy have an aspect of science, craft, worldview, and deep participation, engagement. Moreover, they are deeply interconnected and I would even say, **synoptically integrated**.

It is important to me that these conceptual frames fit into a coherent whole and contribute in a practical way towards a good life. When I started the blog in 2017, my work was at the center (metaphorically and literally), but now the golden thread is **philosophy as a way of life**.

[Unfortunately, I have none of the answers of how does Intelligence, Rationality, Wisdom contribute to meaning in life -- at best, some plausible hypotheses]{.aside}

I can't emphasise enough the importance of different levels of "knowing": propositional, procedural, perspectival, and participatory -- as it is not enough to know the facts (or have beliefs), but to know how to do something, to have a perspective of the "world" and a sense of participation in whatever you're engaged in. I mean that we're **agents** in different **arenas** of life, and the sense of meaning comes from an **attunement** to those arenas. We participate in a course of something, which has impact on the environment, which changes us and how we view and relate to the world, self and others.

Unsurprisingly, there will be lots of painting metaphors when it comes to simplicity, and cognitive science references when talking about ways in which we're biased and foolish. Chess, of course, inspires analogies of competition, strategy, and tactics to its service.
