      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Future of Economics Uses the Science of Real-Life Social Networks&amp;rdquo; - PAUL OMEROD 1
 The goal of this project is not to make a report or literature review or synthesis, rather to get some hands-on experience in working with Graphs and Network Data based on some classical and original (own) datasets and problems. It will involve both some theoretical understanding and programming. The outcome would be to get comfortable with this type of data and maybe build the ground for some future research.</description>
