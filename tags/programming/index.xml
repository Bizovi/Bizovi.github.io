      <description>I wish somebody showed me the real power of R earlier and explained the big picture
This is not an usual tutorial on R, my goal being to make you aware and curious about various topics related to Data Analysis in R, which I learned the hard way during a year of nearly daily use. It is not supposed to be easy or have a particular application in mind, but rather to suggest many possibilities.</description>
